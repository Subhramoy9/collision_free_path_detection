# Autonomous Vehicle Collision-Free Path Detection

This project aims to detect collision-free paths for autonomous vehicles using Q-learning.

## Features

- `RobotCar` class to simulate the movement of an autonomous vehicle.
- `Environment` class to represent the environment with obstacles.
- Q-learning algorithm implementation to learn collision-free paths.
